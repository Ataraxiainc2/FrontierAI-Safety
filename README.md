FrontierAI-Safety
A Comprehensive Framework for Evaluating Safety in Frontier AI Models
<!-- Puedes agregar un banner representativo del proyecto -->

📜 Overview
The FrontierAI-Safety project focuses on evaluating the safety and ethical robustness of advanced AI models, particularly in the context of:

Adversarial misuse resistance
Ethical dilemma handling
Bias in emergent reasoning capabilities
Detection of high-stakes deception
By applying structured testing methodologies and leveraging cutting-edge frameworks, this repository aims to strengthen the safeguards around Frontier AI systems.

🚀 Features
Adversarial Testing Scenarios: Multi-step prompts designed to probe ethical and safety vulnerabilities.
Ethical Evaluation Metrics: Quantifiable metrics like the Composite Ethical Risk Metric (CERM).
Automated Safety Evaluation: Scripts for testing adversarial resistance and reasoning stability.
Documentation in LaTeX: Well-organized documentation to ensure clarity and reproducibility.
Conceptual Frameworks: Diagrams and theoretical models for ethical risk analysis.

📊 Evaluation Metrics
We use the Composite Ethical Risk Metric (CERM) to assess the model's safety performance. This metric considers:

Probability of harmful outputs
Bias indicators in decision-making
Disclosure of unintended harmful knowledge
For details, refer to the Metrics Documentation.

📖 Documentation
Comprehensive documentation is available in the docs/ directory. It includes:

Evaluation frameworks
Mathematical models for ethical testing
Step-by-step instructions for reproducing results
